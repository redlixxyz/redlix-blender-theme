## Overview

Redlix is a carefully crafted interface theme that balances utilitarian design with visual warmth. Drawing inspiration from vintage computing terminals and industrial materials, it offers a comfortable workspace for extended creative sessions.

## Color Palette

The theme uses a cohesive palette of warm, muted tones:

- **Propaganda Red** (`#C23A2B`) - Active states and primary actions
- **Warm Bronze** (`#D4793A`) - Warnings and secondary states
- **Brass Accent** (`#B8954F`) - Cursors, selections, highlights
- **Retro Terminal** (`#2D6B6B`) - Information states
